      "Kraken is a metagenomic classification algorithm. This means that it inspects sequence reads from a sample presumably containing multiple species and attempts to identify the species present. These algorithms are most useful for microbiologists trying to identify bacteria species in environments such as a body of water or an animal's gut. Kraken stores a database of all $k$-mers from 2,256 reference genomes. The reference genomes' associated species are organized in a *phylogenetic tree*, where each species' node is attached to that of its most immediate ancestor:"
