      "As you probably know, disk access is painfully slow and should be avoided at all costs. Often, programs use a large set, a group of unique values, that cannot fit in RAM and must be stored on disk. In a simple set implementation, we must access the full set data in order to add a value (regardless of whether it's already a member) and to check whether a value is a member.\n",
      "\n",
      "For many use cases, it would be very useful to have a smaller data structure stored in memory that estimates whether a value is a member of our set. Because this structure would be much smaller than the full set, thereby storing much less information, it could not give a definitive answer. However, instead of returning \u201cTrue\u201d or \u201cFalse\u201d when asked if a set contains a value, our \u201cfirst-pass filter\u201d could return \u201cPossibly\u201d or \u201cFalse\u201d. When it returns \u201cPossibly\u201d, the full set must then be searched to determine whether the value is actually a member. When it returns \u201cFalse\u201d, though, we do not need to access disk.\n",
      "\n",
      "A simple solution to this problem would be storing each value\u2019s [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) in a list. Hash functions are many-to-one; multiple values can have the same hash, but each value has only one valid hash. If a value\u2019s hash exists in our list, it might be in the set, or the set might just contain another value with the same hash. If the value\u2019s hash isn\u2019t in the list, the value definitely isn\u2019t in the set.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first-pass list filter is a decent solution, but it isn\u2019t quite ideal. Ignoring hash collisions (two values having the same hash), it grows in proportion to the set, and can therefore become unwieldy for really big sets. Assuming we don\u2019t want to use extra memory to make a hash table of the hashes, we need to spend log(n) time finding a hash if the list is sorted, and linear time if it isn\u2019t.\n",

      "Bloom filters, an alternative, offer constant space and constant lookup time. While the rate of false positives (\u201cProbably\u201d responses for values not in the set) increases modestly as the set grows, relatively small Bloom filters have low (~1%) false positive rates for very large data sets.\n",

Similarly, we may want to find if and where a genome sequence read differs from a reference genome.
